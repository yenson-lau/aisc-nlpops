      "\"editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , soledad o'brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill . an inmate housed on the `` forgotten floor , '' where many mentally ill inmates are housed in miami before trial . miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the ninth floor of the miami-dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the `` forgotten floor . '' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .\"\n"
