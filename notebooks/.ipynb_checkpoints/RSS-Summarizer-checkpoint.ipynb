      "The best way to prevent the spread of infections is to keep your hands\n",
      "clean, so it's no surprise that as the coronavirus spreads, stores are\n",
      "running out of hand sanitizer. Fortunately, old-fashioned soap and\n",
      "water will also do the trick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microbiologist Keith Warriner said, if you're using a hand sanitizer,\n",
      "it must contain at least 60 per cent alcohol — the ingredient that\n",
      "kills the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you haven't got enough [alcohol] in there, it doesn't do anything.\n",
      "It has basically dried the virus onto your hand,\" said Warriner, a\n",

      "\"You're actually physically removing it.\"\n",

      "hand sanitizer are equally effective — as long as when using either\n",
      "product, you cover all parts of your hands. That would include each\n",
      "finger, the fingernail area and the fronts and backs of your hands,\n",
      "all the way down to your wrists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you're not following the proper technique, then it's not going to\n",

      "Srigley, a practising physician and professor at the University of\n",
      "British Columbia.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "But she said a mask won't necessarily protect you from catching the\n",

      "\n",
      "She points out that people often end up touching their face when\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's actually not protecting you against the most common way the\n",
      "virus is spreading.\"\n",

      "If you still want to wear a face mask, there are two main types on the\n",

      "which Warriner warns is unable to completely block out the tiny\n",
      "coronavirus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's certainly not foolproof,\" he said. \"You can't go and stand in\n",
      "the middle of a room with people with coronavirus and say, 'Look at\n",
      "me. I'm immune to it.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The second type of mask is the called the N95 which has a firmer\n",

      "getting seriously ill from the virus.\n",
      "\n",

      "but instead by staying rested and drinking plenty of liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The thing that really takes our immune system down is being\n",
      "dehydrated, being stressed, lack of sleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when it comes to stocking up on food, people should be wary of\n",
